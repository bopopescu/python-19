BST.py

Sorry, python seems to be picky about naming conventions for import files
I have numerous test files that I am not uploading, they are briefly described in BSTclient

(1)  For the file http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342.txt.utf-8, what is the depth of your tree?  What does that say about the number of operations to find a word?

Depth 28.  At worst case, to find a word we would have to search from the root to the leaf farthest from the root, which would be the depth/height.  On average trees with n nodes have O(log n) depth/height, worst case as described in Q2 would have O(n) depth/height.

(2)  What would happen if the input to your program were sorted (as it was in HW 2)?

Sorted input is actually very bad for a BST.  This would be worst case scenario for a BST O(n^2) because it would be a linked list with no left subtrees.  A self balancing tree worst case would be O(blog n).

(3)  What are applications for binary search tree?  In what ways are they superior to lists?  In what ways are they inferior to lists?

Sorting and search algorithms can be very efficient (especially in a balanced tree), attributes are stored in a way that make adding and deleting very efficient (one operation to change the pointer). As opposed to an array/list where data has to be copied and moved to delete and add.  They are dynamic as opposed to an array/list that is fixed in size and memory. The shape of a tree depends on the order of insertions, with sorted input for example, the tree becomes less efficient.  Each key has to be compared adding to run time.   In a BST random access is not allowed and to search we must traverse the entire tree as opposed to a list/array which is indexed.  


(4)  Did you implement the extra credit (listed below)?  If so please explain your testing strategy on the extra credit.
Nope
