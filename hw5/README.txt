Q2: what operations are you referring to that have running time O(n^2) and O(nlogn)?; Q3: we were looking for some real world applications as well; Excellent test cases for the tree, however, I dont see where you tested different user queries (eg. empty query, two-word query, etc., or where you tested malformed filenames given by the user; program fails to read input file with only one word properly (likely due to failure to read last word in the file); query text should be processed using same rules as text file (i.e. strip special chars)
