In your write up, please discuss these issues:  What are the boundary cases? What happens if catalog.txt comes in an unexpected format? What happens if a link is broken or the contents come in an unexpected format? etc.  

Boundary cases for file in; empty file, file with too few arguments, file with too many arguments, file titled incorrectly.  Duplicate titles is an issue, but I didn’t solve for it. For URL open; connection timeout, incorrect url, incomplete url.  There is also the possibility of URL mismatch, but I did not solve for that.

I have a try/catch set up if catalog.txt comes in an unexpected format.  Granted I’m being lazy and not really catching anything, just out to the user the error, since my OS could care less about this program. Any file named incorrectly will throw IOError.  I also have it set up to exit if the lines in the file are not formatted as expected.  It’s rudimentary, some corner cases will make it through - such as two items on each line separated by a comma that are complete gibberish won’t exit the program.

That case would be caught by the try/catch for urllib2 which will throw an exception for ValueError or URLError  (I believe that includes socket or timeout error).  Again this will exit the program and just out to the user the error.

As usual I wrote each phase independently and tested functionality, especially for phase two this allowed me to test for logical errors (which there were many) before testing the entire program.  For user input I decided to strip words of punctuation and change to lower case so there was no confusion about the word we were looking for.

For tests on the entire program I ran some of the files through the BST I wrote for HW5 to compare word counts.  See following.
